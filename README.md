# room-assistant companion app for iOS

This app broadcasts BLE services for presence detection purposes.
It allows room-assistant to detect your room presence even though the actually advertised address is randomized.
The app is currently being distributed via Testflight.

Disclaimer: This is my first time working with iOS or Swift. Any help from experienced devs in this field is appreciated!
